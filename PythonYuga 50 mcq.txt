53. Once we have defined a function, we can call it?

True
False
Answer: A) True

Explanation:

Once a function has been defined, it can be called from another function, a program, or even from the Python prompt itself. To call a function, we simply type the name of the function followed by the appropriate parameters into the command line.

For example-

def user_name(name):
    # This function greets to user 
    # to put name
    print("Hello, " + name + ".")

user_name("Amit")	# Amit passed as function argument

54. Amongst which of the following shows the types of function calls in Python?

Call by value
Call by reference
Both A and B
None of the mentioned above
Answer: C) Both A and B

Explanation:

Call by value and Call by reference are the types of function calls in Python.

Call by value - When, we call a function with the values i.e. to pass the variables (not their references), the values of the passing arguments cannot be changed inside the function.
Call by reference - When, we call a function with the reference/object, the values of the passing arguments can be changed inside the function.

56. Amongst which of the following is a function which does not have any name?

Del function
Show function
Lambda function
None of the mentioned above
Answer: C) Lambda function

Explanation:

Lambda function is an anonymous function, which means that it does not have a name, as opposed to other functions. Unlike other programming languages, Python allows us to declare functions without using the def keyword, which is what we would normally do to declare a function. As an alternative, the lambda keyword is used to declare the anonymous functions that will be used throughout the program. When compared to other functions, lambda functions can accept any number of arguments, but they can only return a single value, which is represented by an expression.

Syntax:

lambda arguments: expression

57. Can we pass List as an argument in Python function?

Yes
No
Answer: A) Yes

Explanation:

In a function, we can pass any data type as an argument, such as a string or a number or a list or a dictionary, and it will be treated as if it were of that data type inside the function. The following code exemplifies this –

def St_list(student):
  for x in student:
    print(x)
students = ["Anil", "Rex", "Jerry"]
St_list(students) 

"""
Output:

58. A method refers to a function which is part of a class?

True
False
Answer: A) True

Explanation:

A method is a function that is a part of a class that has been defined. It is accessed through the use of an instance or object of the class. A function, on the other hand, is not restricted in this way: it simply refers to a standalone function. This implies that all methods are functions, but that not all functions are methods in the same sense.

59. The return statement is used to exit a function?

True
False
Answer: A) True

Explanation:

The return statement is used to exit a function and go back to the place from where it was called.

Syntax of return:

return [expression_list]
In this statement, you can include an expression that will be evaluated and the resulting value will be returned. A function will return the None object if there is no expression in the statement or if the return statement itself is not present within a function's body.

60. Scope and lifetime of a variable declared in a function exist till the function exists?

True
False
Answer: A) True

Explanation:

It is the portion of a program where a variable is recognized that is referred to as its scope. It is not possible to see the parameters and variables defined within a function from outside of the function. As a result, they are limited in their application. The lifetime of a variable is the period of time during which the variable is stored in the memory of the computer. The lifetime of variables contained within a function is equal to the length of time the function is in operation. When we return from the function, they are completely destroyed. As a result, a function does not retain the value of a variable from previous calls to the function.

61. File handling in Python refers the feature for reading data from the file and writing data into a file?

True
False
Answer: A) True

Explanation:

File handling is the capability of reading data from and writing it into a file in Python. Python includes functions for creating and manipulating files, whether they are flat files or text documents. We will not need to import any external libraries in order to perform general IO operations because the IO module is the default module for accessing files.

64. Binary files are stored in the form of 0s and 1s?

True
False
Answer: A) True

Explanation:

Binary files are also stored in terms of bytes (0s and 1s), but, unlike text files, these bytes do not represent the ASCII values of the characters that are contained within them. A binary file is a sequence of bytes that is stored in a computer's memory. Even a single bit change can corrupt a file, rendering it unreadable by the application that is attempting to read it. In addition, because the binary file's contents are not human readable, it is difficult to correct any errors that may occur in the binary file.

65. The function file_object.close() is used to ___.

To open the existing file
To append in an opened file
To close an opened file
None of the mentioned above
Answer: C) To close an opened file

Explanation:

To close a file that has been opened, use the file object.close() function. To accomplish this, the Python language provides the close() method. When a file is closed, the system releases the memory that was allocated to it.

Discuss this Question

66. Python always makes sure that any unwritten or unsaved data is written to the file before it is closed?

True
False
Answer: A) True

Explanation:

Whenever a file is closed, Python ensures that any unwritten or unsaved data is flushed out or written to the file's header before the file is closed. As a result, it is always recommended that we close the file once our work is completed. Additionally, if the file object is reassigned to a different file, the previous file is automatically closed as well.

67. The write() method takes a string as an argument and ___.

writes it to the text file
read from the text file
append in a text file
None of the mentioned above
Answer: A) writes it to the text file

Explanation:

The write() method accepts a string as an argument and writes it to the text file specified by the filename parameter. The write() method returns the number of characters that were written during a single execution of the write() function. A newline character (n) must also be added at the end of every sentence to indicate the end of a line.

69. Amongst which of the following function is / are used to create a file and writing data?

append()
open()
close()
None of the mentioned above
Answer: B) open()

Explanation:

To create a text file, we call the open() method and pass it the filename and the mode parameters to the function. If a file with the same name already exists, the open() function will behave differently depending on whether the write or append mode is used to open the file. Write mode (w) will cause all of the existing contents of the file to be lost, and a new file with the same name will be created with the same contents as the existing file.

71. The module Pickle is used to ___.

Serializing Python object structure
De-serializing Python object structure
Both A and B
None of the mentioned above
Answer: C) Both A and B

Explanation:

Pickle is a Python module that allows you to save any object structure along with its associated data. Pickle is a Python module that can be used to serialize and de-serialize any type of Python object structure. Serialization is the process of converting data or an object stored in memory to a stream of bytes known as byte streams, which is a type of data stream. These byte streams, which are contained within a binary file, can then be stored on a disc, in a database, or transmitted over a network. Pickling is another term for the serialization process. De-serialization, also known as unpickling, is the inverse of the pickling process, in which a byte stream is converted back to a Python object through the pickling process.

72. Amongst which of the following is / are the method of convert Python objects for writing data in a binary file?

set() method
dump() method
load() method
None of the mentioned above
Answer: B) dump() method

Explanation:

The dump() method is used to convert Python objects into binary data that can be written to a binary file. The file into which the data is to be written must be opened in binary write mode before the data can be written. To make use of the dump() method, we can call this function with the parameters data object and file object. There are two objects in this case: data object and file object. The data object object is the object that needs to be dumped to the file with the file handle named file_ object.

73. Amongst which of the following is / are the method used to unpickling data from a binary file?

load()
set() method
dump() method
None of the mentioned above
Answer: B) set() method

Explanation:

The load() method is used to unpickle data from a binary file that has been compressed. The binary read (rb) mode is used to load the file that is to be loaded. If we want to use the load() method, we can write Store object = load(file object) in our program. The pickled Python object is loaded from a file with a file handle named file object and stored in a new file handle named store object. The pickled Python object is loaded from a file with a file handle named file object and stored in a new file handle named store object.

75. The writelines() method is used to write multiple strings to a file?

True
False
Answer: A) True

Explanation:
